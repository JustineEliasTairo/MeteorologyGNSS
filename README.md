 GNSS Meteorogy - Estimation of IWV using conventional Meteorological data and GNSS Fusion

 In recent studies, the application of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) has expanded in an exponential rate especially for services that needs high precision and accuracy.

GNSS Meteorology, which derives the integrated water vapor (IWV) in the atmosphere and hence make possible the NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction); is the usage of GNSS broadcasted signals to provide information about the state of the troposphere. 
This layer is exploited by measuring the tropospheric error which is induced into GNSS solution after the signal being delayed when passing through it. As troposphere is the layer of the atmosphere that extends 9 – 16km above the earth’s surface 
which is made up of water vapor and dry gases. Several empirical models give the estimate of its delay which is further used to derive the ZTD (Zenith total delay), ZHD (Zenith hydrostatic delay) and ZWD (Zenith wet delay) which are very essential 
to the derivation of IWV.
